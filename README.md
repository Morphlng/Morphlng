I'm currently a dedicated and curious graduate student at the *Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences*, and my research is focused on the dynamic and challenging field of **Reinforcement Learning**. 🎓🧠

In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm a strong advocate of open-source 🌐 and a passionate developer. I find great pleasure in tinkering with the underpinnings of technology. I've created a diverse range of repositories, from custom programming languages 💬 to software renderers 💻 and NES console emulators 🎮. Each project is a new learning opportunity and a chance to connect with the vibrant open-source community!

### My Projects 🚀
- **Cploxplox**: Building a language from scratch gave me insights into the nuances of language design, compiler theory, and low-level computing. `Cploxplox` is an interpretive programming language that is designed to use combined with [QBloxly](https://github.com/Morphlng/QBloxly), a drag-and-drop interactive GUI interface designed for kids. The name comes from the root language C++ and the reference design of [lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Check it out [here](https://github.com/Morphlng/cploxplox) to learn more.
- **Software Renderer**: A deep dive into 3D graphics, I developed a custom software renderer, handling everything from basic geometry to advanced shading techniques. `foolrenderer` was originally a software renderer written under C99 standard. I've port it to C++17 to take full advantage of C++ and provide much more flexiblity. Here's the [link](https://github.com/Morphlng/foolrenderer_Cpp).
- **NES Console Emulator**: A nostalgic return to the classic NES console, this emulator project helped me explore hardware-software interactions, low-level programming, and game engine architecture. `Qt-Nes` is a Nes emulator written in Qt5 as the only dependency. Explore it [here](https://github.com/Morphlng/Qt_Nes_Emulator).

I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to contribute to open-source projects. So, if you're working on something interesting, feel free to get in touch 📬.
